For FreeRTOS kernel feature information refer to the
[Developer Documentation](https://www.freertos.org/Documentation/02-Kernel/02-Kernel-features/00-Developer-docs),
and [API Reference](https://www.freertos.org/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/01-Task-creation/00-TaskHandle).

## Getting started

The following sections describe the quick steps to build and execute using QSPI boot.

## Getting the toolchain

The toolchain can be downloaded from ARM developer [website](https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu/14.3.rel1/binrel/arm-gnu-toolchain-14.3.rel1-x86_64-aarch64-none-elf.tar.xz).

### Installing the toolchain

Follow the below commands to install the toolchain

```bash
AARCH64_TOOLCHAINPATH=<desired toolchain path>
mkdir -p $AARCH64_TOOLCHAINPATH
cd $AARCH64_TOOLCHAINPATH
cp <download folder>/arm-gnu-toolchain-14.3.rel1-x86_64-aarch64-none-elf.tar.xz .
tar -xf arm-gnu-toolchain-14.3.rel1-x86_64-aarch64-none-elf.tar.xz
rm arm-gnu-toolchain-14.3.rel1-x86_64-aarch64-none-elf.tar.xz
export PATH=$AARCH64_TOOLCHAINPATH/arm-gnu-toolchain-14.3.rel1-x86_64-aarch64-none-elf/bin/:$PATH
```
## Getting Quartus
Follow the steps in the official [website](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software-kit/865547/intel-quartus-prime-pro-edition-design-software-version-25-3-for-windows.html).<br>
Download and install Quartus

## Building the image

The following steps will generate a qspi image which can be flashed into the PDK

### Set up the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Ignitarium-Technology/freertos-socfpga.git
cd freertos-socfpga
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Set up the toolchain and Quartus
- Export Quartus path required to build jic file. **Note** Quartus needs to be exported only if you are planning to build qspi image.
```bash
export QUARTUS_ROOTDIR=~/altera_pro/25.3/quartus/
export PATH=$QUARTUS_ROOTDIR/bin:$QUARTUS_ROOTDIR/linux64:$QUARTUS_ROOTDIR/../qsys/bin:$PATH
```
- Export the toolchain path.
```bash
AARCH64_TOOLCHAINPATH=<toolchain path>
export PATH=$AARCH64_TOOLCHAINPATH/arm-gnu-toolchain-14.3.rel1-x86_64-aarch64-none-elf/bin/:$PATH
```
### Decide the build options

The following parameters can be specified during the CMake configuration stage:

- **AGILEX5 vs. AGILEX3**<br>
  Select the SOC to build app for, supported SOC's are AGILEX 5 and AGILEX 3
  ```bash
  -DSOC=[AGILEX5|AGILEX3]
  ```
  Build will default to Agilex 5 if not specified or an invalid option is selected

- **Debug vs. Release**<br>
  By default, the build system compiles in **Release** mode. To build a debug version of the application, specify the option:
  ```bash
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
  ```

- **A55 vs. A76 Boot**<br>
  By default, the build system compiles for **A55** as the boot core. To tune for A76 boot core version of the application, specify the option:
  ```bash
  -DCORE=A76
  ```

- **ATF Log Level**<br>
  The default ATF log level is set to `LOG_LEVEL_NOTICE`. To use a different ATF debug log level, specify it using:
  ```bash
  -DATF_LOG_LEVEL=<log-level-value>
  ```

- **SOF File**<br>
  To build SD/eMMC or QSPI image, A .sof file is mandatory.
  The SOF path can be set with:
  ```bash
  -DSOF_PATH=<sof-path>
  ```
- **PFG File**<br>
  To build SD/eMMC or QSPI image, A .pfg file is mandatory.
  Specify a PFG file for either or both according to the build requirements.
  ```bash
  -DPFG_SDMMC=<pfg-file>
  -DPFG_QSPI=<pfg-file>
  ```

### Flash the image and execute

#### Agilex 5
Put the device in JTAG mode to flash the JIC image, refer [Changing MSEL](https://altera-fpga.github.io/rel-25.1/embedded-designs/agilex-5/e-series/premium/gsrd/ug-gsrd-agx5e-premium/#development-kit) section.<br>
After setting the MSEL Turn on the device, Use the following command to flash the firmware to the device.<br>
The .jic images will be in the build folder,
- QSPI boot: <build folder>/qspi_atf_binaries/qspi_image.jic
- SD card boot: <build folder>/sd_atf_binaries/qspi_image.jic
- EMMC boot: <build folder>/emmc_atf_binaries/qspi_image.jic
Navigate to the appropriate folder and run the following command

```bash
#use the image qspi_image.jic
quartus_pgm -c 1 -m jtag -o "piv;qspi_image.jic"
```
Power down the device, set the MSEL back to QSPI mode and then power on to boot the application.
#### Agilex 3
Power on the device and use the following command to flash the firmware to the device
```bash
#use the image qspi_image.jic
quartus_pgm -c 1 -m jtag -o "piv;qspi_image.jic@2"
```
Power cycle the device
