 * Sample Application for HPS-FPGA bridges
 *
 * @details
 * @section bridge_desc Description
 * This is a sample application to demonstrate the hps-fpga bridge driver. In this sample application,
 * only the hps2fpga and lwhps2fpga bridges are demonstrated. Remaning bridges can also be used in the
 * same way. The sample can be devided into two sections as below :-
 *      - @b hps2fpga @b bridge <br>
 *           The HPS2FPGA bridges extends the HPS peripherals to the FPGA. Any additional IPs implemented
 *           in the FPGA fabric can be used from the HPS subsystem. In the sample application, basic memory
 *           validation test is perfomed. Data is written to the start and end address of the first 1G memory
 *           area of the HPS2FPGA bridge and is read back and compared with initial buffers.
 *
 *      - @b lwhps2fpga @b bridge <br>
 *           The LWHPS2FPGA bridge has almost the same funcitonality as the HPS2FPGA bridge. This is specifically
 *           meant for narrower use case invloving simple peripherals on the fpga with strongly ordered single
 *           transactions. The sample for lwhps2fpga bridge has the following features :-
 *           - Read the sysid
 *           - Toggle an LED connected through the lwhpsfpga bridge, where the LED is mapped to LED D16 on the PDK.
 *
 * @section bridge_pre Prerequisites
 * - All the four HPS-FPGA bridges require its own rbf files to be loaded before running the sample. Ensure that
 * the sd card has been prepared with the required rbf files, and the name of the rbf file is <br>
 * properly updated in this sample app. The sample implementation is based on the GHRD design.
 *
 * @section bridge_howto How to Run
 * 1. Follow the common README for build and flashing instructions.
 * 2. Copy all the required rbf file to the SD card, and run the sample.
 *
 * @note File names should conform to the 8.3 format (maximum 8 characters for the name and 3 for the extension).
 *
 * @section bridge_res Expected Results
 * - The SYSTEM ID of all the individual fpga bridge will be displayed in the console.
 * - If the bitstream has been loaded successfully, the ID will displayed.
 * - The buffer comparison status will be displayed.
 *
 * @note Due to a fatfs limitation, all the rbf file names should be limited to 8.3 characters.
