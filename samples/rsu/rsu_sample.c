 *
 * Sample Application for RSU
 *
 * @details
 * @section rsu_description Description
 * This is a simple program to demonstrate the use of librsu library. The sample application erases slot 1 and programs an application image from the SD card to that slot,
 * verifies it, and loads it. The sample also performs a ROS (Remote OS update) operation on the corresponding SSBL slot (i.e., it erases, programs, and verifies the SSBL slot
 * corresponding to slot 1, which is slot 3 for the pfg file that the sample uses). The user can refer to the <a href="https://altera-fpga.github.io/rel-24.3/
 * embedded-designs/agilex-5/e-series/premium/rsu/ug-rsu-agx5e-soc/#creating-the-initial-flash-image">Creating the Flash Image</a> to understand more about
 * creating the initial image needed for RSU (Remote System Update) and ROS (Remote OS update) in Linux-based systems. The pfg in the link, however,
 * requires some changes to be used for FreeRTOS. The bitstream's 'hps_path' should be updated with the path to 'bl2.hex' instead of 'u-boot-spl-dtb.hex'.
 * The user can also add additional slots to accommodate fip (SSBL) binaries or additional images (for reference, refer to the pfg in the rsu samples folder).
 * For the steps to create the application image, the user can refer to the link <a href="https://altera-fpga.github.io/rel-24.3/embedded-designs/agilex-5/
 * e-series/premium/rsu/ug-rsu-agx5e-soc/#creating-the-application-image">Creating the Application Image</a>. To create an application image that
 * supports FreeRTOS, the user must replace the argument 'hps_path' with the path to 'bl2.hex' instead of the path 'u-boot-spl-dtb.hex'. When the user creates
 * the QSPI image, the creation of the application image is automatically taken care of. The user can copy 'app2.rpd' from the samples/build/build/qspi-atf-binaries/
 * folder to the SD card. For ROS update, the user can copy a valid 'fip.bin' (with the same ATF version) to the SD card. For this sample, it is assumed that a
 * valid fip binary named 'fip2.bin' is used. Both the fip binary and application image must be present in the FAT partition of the SD card.
 *
 * @section rsu_prerequisites Prerequisites
 * - Make sure to use a RSU supported image having  at least 2 slots with ATF version 2.12.0 or later
 * - Ensure that a rpd file is stored on the SD card, and its name matches the variable(file name shall be 8 characters or below) 'rsu_file_name' <br>
 * - Ensure that a fip.bin file is stored on the SD card, and its name matches the variable(file name shall be 8 characters or below) 'ros_file_name' <br>
 * - The sample pfg file used to create the initial RSU jic image is available at @c drivers/samples/rsu/initial_image.pfg which creates 6 slots(0 to 5).
 *
 * @section rsu_param Configurable Parameters
 * - The application image slot to be updated is defined with @c RSU_SLOT macro.
 * - The fip binary (SSBL) slot to be updated is defined with @c ROS_SLOT macro(if P1 slot is updated update SSBL.P1).
 * - The name of the application image is stored in the variable @c rsu_file_name.
 * - The name of the fip binary(SSBL) is stored in the variable @c ros_file_name.
 *
 * @section rsu_how_to_run How to Run
 * 1. Follow the common README for build and flashing instructions.
 * 2. Run the application on the board with the appropriate RSU image.
 * 3. After the successful execution of the sample application the board goes for a warm reboot. Restart the board to load the new slot.
 *
 * @section rsu_expected_results Expected Results
 * - The board goes for a warm reboot. Then after a power cycle the board boots up in the new slot.
