/**

 * @ingroup drivers
 * @brief APIs for Soc FPGA I3C driver.
 * @details
 *
 * This driver provides methods to perform  operations with an I3C
 * or an I2C device connected to the SoC FPGA I3C bus.
 *
 * The driver supports DAA and DASA and can communicate with both I2C and I3C
 * devices connected to the bus in interrupt mode. For I3C devices the
 * I3C controller will assign an address if needed whereas for an I2C device its
 * static address is used to communicate with the controller.
 *
 * A typical usage flow is as below:
 *
 * 1. Initialize the driver using the `i3c_open` API.
 * 2. Prepare an array of type `struct i3c_i3c_device`. Each entry in the array should be
 *    filled with the properties of the I3C or I2C device present on the bus.
 * 3. Use the `I3C_IOCTL_TARGET_ATTACH` IOCTL to attach the devices. Use the above
 *    array as the parameter to this IOCTL.
 * 4. Use the `I3C_IOCTL_BUS_INIT` IOCTL to trigger dynamic address assignment.
 * 5. For I3C devices, use the `I3C_GET_DYNADDRESS` IOCTL to get the dynamic address.
 * 6. For I2C devices, use the `I2C_IOCTL_ADDRESS_VALID` to verify that the slave address is valid.
 * 7. Perform read/write operations as desired using the `i3c_transfer_sync` API.
 *
 * To see example usage, see @ref i3c_sample "I3C sample application"
